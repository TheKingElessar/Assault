## Game Cycle

1. Everybody starts in a lobby world
2. Each player that wants to join the game signifies it by running a command or something, then they're added to a list
3. Once the game has enough players, the game instance is created, the map/players passed to it, and the game world created
4. All the players are moved to the game world (on the waiting platform)
5. The countdown starts
6. Teams are split, and sent to their defending base in build mode.
7. Once building time is up, the attackers start.
8. Once time is up or the objective is reached, the teams switch sides.
9. Once time is up or the objective is reached, the winner is decided, and everything goes bog wild.

#### Planning

Misc., inconsequential questions to answer in the future:

 - Should health be visible to enemies?
