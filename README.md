## Todo

- Transportation out of base for defenders
- Emerald spawning

## Bugs

- When swapping attacking teams, the attacking/defending teams aren't correct in gameInstance. This impacts the timers
  among other things.
- Enemies are able to attack each other during the Building stage.
- The Saloon map bases aren't self-contained with barrier blocks, allowing people to move between them if they build
  outside the map.

## Roadmap

- Resource generation/gathering
    - Emeralds spawn in physical locations near each base
- Shops
    - Armor?
    - Gamer Shop (team buffs)
        - Potion effects
        - Movement buffs
- Lobby/game instance stuff
    - Moving players in/out of game
    - Map voting
    - Joining/leaving game while it's running
- Game modifiers (admin set or voting)

## Game Cycle

1. Everybody starts in a lobby world
2. Each player that wants to join the game signifies it by running a command or something, then they're added to a list
3. Once the game has enough players, the game instance is created, the map/players passed to it, and the game world
   created
4. All the players are moved to the game world (on the waiting platform)
5. The countdown starts
6. Teams are split, and sent to their defending base in build mode.
7. Once building time is up, the attackers start.
8. Once time is up or the objective is reached, the teams switch sides.
9. Once time is up or the objective is reached, the winner is decided, and everything goes bog wild.

#### Planning

Misc., inconsequential questions to answer in the future:

- Should health be visible to enemies?
- Are gamer points shared throughout entire team or kept by individual players?
