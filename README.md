## Roadmap

 - Restructure current world setup
    - There should be as many worlds as the server wants, since each world is a map.
 - Spawning on game start and death
 - How to get money
    - Coins automatically tick up
    - Emeralds spawn in physical locations near each base
    - GP on kill
 - Shops
    - UBOM (physical items)
        - Weapons
        - Blocks
        - Utility items
    - Gamer Shop (team buffs)
        - Potion effects
        - Movement buffs

### Completed

 - Build example map for testing (blue at least)

---

#### Shops

UBOM: The normal shop that both teams use

Gamer Shop: Attackers spend Gamer Points (earned by killing defenders) on buffs

---

#### Planning

Misc., inconsequential questions to answer in the future:

 - Should health be visible to enemies?
